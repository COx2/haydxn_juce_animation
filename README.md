# haydxn_juce_animation
This is an updated version of the 2011 JUCE animation package github contributor 'haydxn' created, as I found it in a zip file at this link: https://forum.juce.com/t/animation-framework/6794

In this repo I brought it up to the JUCE v5.3.2, and ensured it compiles and runs on XCode 10.1. I also added a rotation animation to the mix.
